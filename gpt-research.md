# Client Lifecycle for a UK Independent Mortgage Broker (Lead to Post-Completion)

## Overview

An independent mortgage broker's client journey spans from the moment a lead is captured to long after the mortgage completes. Below we break down each stage – from Initial Lead Capture through Qualification, Document Collection, Product Recommendation, Application Submission, Mortgage Offer, Completion, and Post-Completion Follow-up – describing key activities and communications. For each stage, we suggest email/document request templates (with Airtable form links for data/doc collection) and highlight opportunities to streamline work with automation and AI. Tools like Airtable (with prefilled forms), Zapier/Make integrations, and OpenAI's GPT can significantly reduce manual tasks while improving client communication. The focus is on practical, cost-effective tools suitable for solo brokers or small teams.

## Stage 1: Lead Capture & Initial Engagement

### Purpose

Capture incoming inquiries and promptly engage the prospect. Leads may come from a website form, online ad, referral, or social media. The goal is to collect basic details and respond quickly to spark the relationship.

### Lead Capture Process

Use a simple online form or CRM intake to gather the prospect's name, contact info, and needs (e.g. first-time buyer, remortgage). For a small brokerage, an Airtable form embedded on the website or a landing page can feed leads directly into an Airtable base (acting as a lightweight CRM). Automation can create a new lead record as soon as the form is submitted.

### Immediate Response

Send an automated welcome email or message as soon as the lead comes in. This email thanks the prospect for their inquiry and outlines next steps (such as scheduling a call or providing more info).

#### Example Welcome Email Template

```
Subject: "Thank You for Your Mortgage Inquiry – Next Steps"

Dear [Name],

Thank you for reaching out about your mortgage options. We're excited to help. To get started, please book a free 15-minute call [using our online scheduler] so we can understand your needs.

In the meantime, you can speed up the process by clicking the link below to provide some initial details.

Link: [Airtable Form – Pre-filled with your contact info]

This secure form lets you share basic details (like income, deposit, etc.) so we can research suitable options before we speak.

Thank you, and we look forward to assisting you!

– [Broker Name], Mortgage Adviser
```

### Tools & Automation

- **Airtable Prefilled Form**: The link in the email can be an Airtable form URL with query parameters to prefill fields (e.g. name, email) that you already have.
- **Immediate Response**: Leverage Airtable Automations (or Zapier) to send the welcome email immediately when a new lead record is added.
- **Scheduling Integration**: Consider integrating a scheduling tool (Calendly or Acuity) so clients can self-book an initial consultation.
- **AI Chatbot**: For after-hours web leads, an AI-powered chatbot on your site can handle basic FAQs and capture lead details in real-time.

## Stage 2: Qualification & Fact Find

### Purpose

Qualify the lead's financial situation and goals to ensure you can assist them, and gather detailed information (the "fact find"). This stage determines the client's borrowing capacity and mortgage eligibility, often culminating in an Agreement in Principle if the client is ready.

### Initial Consultation

Typically, you'll have a discovery call or meeting to understand the client's needs (first-time buyer, moving home, remortgage, etc.) and basic financial picture. At this qualification stage, you generally do not need to collect documents yet – instead, ask key questions about income, employment, credit history, deposit source, etc.

### Fact Find Form

Provide the client with a secure form to capture all necessary details. The form should collect:

- Personal details (DOB, address history, marital status, dependents)

- Employment and income (employer, salary, bonuses or if self-employed, recent earnings)

- Outgoings (monthly commitments, loans, credit cards, childcare costs)

- Deposit amount and source (savings, gift, etc.)

- Property details if known (price, type of property)

- Consent to credit check (if you plan to do a soft credit search for a Decision in Principle)

#### Example Fact Find Email Template

```
Subject: "Let's Get You Mortgage-Ready – Please Complete Your Fact Find"

Hi [Name],

It was great speaking with you about your home purchase plans. As discussed, the next step is to gather your details so I can assess how much you could borrow and which lenders fit best.

Please take a few minutes to complete our secure online Fact Find:

Link: [Airtable Fact Find Form – prefilled with what we know so far]

On the form, you'll confirm information like your income, expenses, and what you're looking to achieve. This information is kept confidential. Once we receive it, I'll be able to start finding the most suitable mortgage options for you.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions while filling it out.

Thanks!
– [Broker Name]
```

### Tools & Automation

- **Airtable Integration**: Use Airtable to organize the fact find responses with calculations for basic affordability

- **Automated Reminders**: Set up automated reminder emails if the fact find isn't completed within a few days

- **AI Assistance**: Use OpenAI GPT to draft summaries or clarifying questions based on the fact find responses

## Stage 3: Document Gathering & Verification

Purpose: Collect all supporting documents from the client to verify the information and satisfy lender requirements. Proper document collection early on prevents delays during underwriting. In this stage, the broker requests and receives documents such as ID, proof of income, and bank statements.

Documents Required: UK mortgage applications typically require a range of documents to prove identity, address, income and finances
mortgageminds.co.uk

uk-mortgagebroker.co.uk
. Common items include:

Proof of ID (passport or driving licence)

Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement, or driving licence if not used as ID)

Proof of income – e.g. last 3 months' payslips and latest P60 (if employed) or 2-3 years of accounts/SA302 tax returns (if self-employed)

Bank statements (usually 3 months, showing salary credits and expenses)

Proof of deposit (e.g. savings account statement or gift letter)

Existing mortgage or rent statements (to verify payment history, if applicable)

Brokers must gather these to assess the client's suitability and later provide them to the lender
contentsnare.com
. "Mortgage brokers typically need to gather a lot of documents... including proof of income, career history, and identification documents."​
contentsnare.com

Document Request Email: It's helpful to send a checklist to the client with all needed documents listed, and an easy way for them to send files. An Airtable document-upload form is extremely useful here – it allows the client to upload files directly, which get attached to their record in your base. For example:

Subject: "Documents Needed – Mortgage Application Preparation"

Hi [Name],

Thanks for providing your details. The next step is to collect your documents to verify your information and speed up the mortgage approval. Please upload the following items using the secure link below:

ID: Passport or driving licence (photo page)

Proof of Address: Recent utility bill or bank statement

Income Proof: Last 3 months' payslips and P60 (if employed) or last 2 years' tax returns (if self-employed)

Bank Statements: Last 3 months (main account)

[Any additional items based on your situation]

Upload Link: [Airtable Document Upload Form – prefilled with your name for identification]

This link lets you securely upload files directly to our system (all data is encrypted). If you have any trouble or prefer email, you can send files directly to me.

Thank you! Once we have these, we'll review and move to the fun part – finding you the best mortgage.

– [Broker Name]

In Airtable, you might create a form with separate file-upload fields for each document category (ID, address, etc.) for clarity. The form can use hidden prefills (like a client ID) so you know which record to attach uploads to. Prefilling a form via URL ensures the uploads link to the client's record​
support.airtable.com
.

Automation & Reminders: Chasing documents can be time-consuming, so automate where possible. For instance, use Airtable automation or Zapier to send a follow-up reminder if certain required fields (attachments) in the client's record are still empty after a few days. Content Snare (a document collection tool) emphasizes scheduling automated reminders at different intervals to keep clients on track​
contentsnare.com
. You can achieve a similar effect with Airtable by setting a timed automation: "If 3 days pass and X document field is still empty, send an email reminding the client which documents are outstanding." This reduces the need to manually follow up.

Streamlining Verification: Consider tools to verify documents faster:

ID verification – Instead of just asking for a passport copy, you could integrate an ID verification service (like Onfido or Veriff) via an API or third-party automation. For a small operation, this might be as simple as using a mobile app to scan and verify the ID's authenticity.

Bank statement analysis – Reviewing bank statements manually is tedious. There are fintech tools (several in the UK offer Open Banking integrations) that let clients grant read-only access to their bank data, producing an income and expenditure report automatically. If that's too complex, another approach is using OCR and AI: for example, Ocrolus is a platform that can read financial documents and extract data, and they have begun adding OpenAI to enhance automated document processing​
nationalmortgagenews.com
. While that might be enterprise-level, even a solo broker can use simpler AI: you could upload a PDF bank statement to an AI service to get a summary of transactions. However, exercise caution with sensitive data – ensure any AI or tool is compliant and secure.

Credit report – If not already done, you may ask the client for a copy of their credit report (from Experian, Equifax, etc.) or use a soft search via a credit agency integration. Some mortgage CRMs integrate credit checks directly; if not, having the client provide their report via the upload form is useful.

AI Assistance: OpenAI's GPT can help here by drafting communications (e.g. a polite reminder email that lists missing documents in a friendly tone, saving you time writing it). You can also use AI to classify and organize documents. For instance, if a client emails you a bundle of files instead of using the form, you might use an AI script to sort which file is which (pay slip vs. bank statement) by reading file names or content. This is advanced, but possible with services like Zapier + OpenAI or custom code. Overall, automation at this stage ensures you get a complete document pack with minimal back-and-forth.

## Stage 4: Mortgage Product Research & Recommendation

Purpose: Analyze the client's information and documents to research suitable mortgage products, then recommend the optimal mortgage solution to the client. This is the advisory step where you present your professional recommendation (including required compliance documents).

Research and Analysis: With a full picture of the client's profile, the broker searches the market for the best mortgage deals that meet the client's needs and eligibility. Often this means using a mortgage sourcing system (common UK broker software includes Twenty7Tec, Trigold, or online sourcing from Mortgage Brain, etc.). These platforms let you filter products by criteria and compare lenders. Modern platforms (like Acre or others) even integrate real-time lender affordability checks and criteria filters​
acresoftware.com
to quickly narrow down viable options. Ensure the deal fits the client's objectives (e.g. fixed rate for stability, or no early repayment charges if they plan to move soon).

Preparing the Recommendation: After identifying the best product, you will prepare a recommendation package for the client. This typically includes:

A Mortgage Illustration (ESIS) – a standardized document with all details of the recommended mortgage (interest rate, monthly payment, fees, total cost, etc.). This can usually be generated from the sourcing system for the chosen product​
mortgageminds.co.uk
.

A Suitability Letter – a personalized letter explaining why the recommendation is suitable, how it meets the client's needs, and discloses any important information (required by FCA regulations). This is often written by the broker using a template, covering what alternatives were considered and why they were not chosen, etc.

Possibly a comparison or research summary – some brokers provide a brief of other products considered or a screenshot of the product research to show due diligence.

In the UK process: "After completing the fact find and reviewing your documents, your broker will research the market to find the best suitable mortgage as per your needs… [They] will share and go through the following to support [the] recommendation: mortgage research details, affordability check, [and] mortgage illustration."​
mortgageminds.co.uk

This highlights that you'll not only give the client the product info but also explain the rationale (e.g. "Lender X offers a 5-year fixed at 4.5% which is the lowest fixed rate you qualify for, given your 10% deposit and credit profile").

Recommendation Delivery (Email & Discussion): Communicate the recommendation to the client, ideally with an explanation and all necessary documents attached. Often, brokers will arrange a call or meeting to walk the client through the recommendation, then send an email recap. However, a clear email is essential so the client can review details at their own pace. Template Email Example:

Subject: "Your Mortgage Recommendation – [Lender Name] 5-year Fixed Rate"

Dear [Name],

After carefully reviewing your situation and searching the market, I'm pleased to recommend a mortgage for you. Here are the highlights of the recommended loan:

Lender: ABC Bank (via broker exclusive deal)

Loan Amount: £200,000 over 25 years

Product: 5-year Fixed Rate at 4.50%

Monthly Payment: ~£1,110 (interest rate fixed until July 2028)

Upfront Fees: £999 arrangement fee (can be added to the loan)

Key Benefits: Provides payment stability for 5 years; you mentioned budgeting certainty is a top priority.

Alternative Options: We considered a 2-year fixed at 4.2%, which has a slightly lower rate but would come up for renewal sooner. Given your preference to lock in a longer term, the 5-year fixed is a better fit.

Attached is the European Standardised Information Sheet (ESIS) – a detailed illustration of this mortgage, and a brief Suitability Letter explaining why this product is right for you. Please review these documents. I'm happy to answer any questions. If you're comfortable with this recommendation, let me know and we will proceed with the full application to secure the deal.

Thank you,
– [Broker Name]

In this email, the broker provides a concise summary and attaches the formal documents. The tone is informative and tailored to the client's stated priorities.

Automation & Tools:

Mortgage Sourcing Software: Use the platforms provided by your network or a standalone tool to quickly source deals. Many are subscription-based, but for a solo broker, it's often worth it. If not, even using comparison sites as a starting point (while not as comprehensive) can help, but ensure you have access to broker-only deals and true affordability calculations.

Templates: Save templates for your recommendation email and Suitability Letter. Airtable can store template text that you personalize, or use a text expansion tool. You could even keep a table in Airtable for various email templates (initial contact, doc request, recommendation, etc.) and have a field that formulates a draft email for each stage using the client's data.

OpenAI for Drafting: Drafting a detailed suitability letter for each client can be repetitive. This is a great opportunity to use OpenAI (ChatGPT) for first drafts. For example, you can feed a prompt with the client's situation and the chosen product, and ask GPT to "Draft a concise letter explaining why a [5-year fixed 4.5% with ABC Bank] is suitable for a [first-time buyer] who wants stability, mentioning alternatives considered." The output can then be edited for compliance and accuracy. Brokers are already experimenting with using ChatGPT to generate such communications. In fact, you can instruct ChatGPT to write in a specific template or tone​
blog.accordmortgages.com
– e.g. "As a UK mortgage broker, write an email encouraging a client to review their mortgage options, using the template provided…". Always review the AI-generated text to ensure it meets regulatory standards, but this can save considerable time on writing.

CRM/Documentation Tools: If using a broker CRM (like the one provided by your brokerage network or a system like Acre), some steps can be semi-automated – e.g. Acre touts "automated suitability reports"​
acresoftware.com
. Even without such a platform, you can automate parts of documentation. For instance, use mail merge or document generation (via Zapier with Google Docs or PDFfiller) to auto-fill the ESIS or a summary sheet with the client's info. Given compliance importance, double-check everything, but automation can populate repetitive fields (client name, loan details) across your documents.

Client Decision Input: If you present multiple options and want the client's formal selection, consider an Airtable form where they tick "I choose Option 1 – 5yr fixed" and perhaps electronically sign. Alternatively, an email confirmation from them is usually sufficient. If using a form, that response can trigger the next stage tasks automatically in Airtable.

## Stage 5: Mortgage Application Submission

Purpose: Submit the mortgage application to the chosen lender, including all data and documents, to get a formal mortgage approval. This stage is about packaging the case and sending it through, then awaiting the lender's underwriting decision.

Application Preparation: Before submission, ensure you have:

The completed application details (often the fact find info is the basis; you may need a few extra pieces like the property address, estate agent and solicitor details for purchases, etc.​
mortgageminds.co.uk
).

All supporting documents (from Stage 3) ready to upload.

Any required compliance steps done (in the UK, you must have given the client an Initial Disclosure Document (IDD) and they've agreed to proceed, and the client needs to agree to the mortgage application credit search which usually they do as part of DIP or your client agreement).

Submission Process: Many lenders allow brokers to submit applications through their online broker portal. You'll log in and input the client's information into the lender's system (or, if integrated software is used, push the data from your CRM to the lender via an API). Upload all the documents, and then submit the application for processing. The lender will then perform underwriting on the case (Stage 6 covers the offer outcome). Some lenders may require additional forms (e.g. a direct debit mandate or a signed declaration from the client), which you should have the client sign and return. Electronic signature tools like DocuSign or SignWell can be handy to get those quickly if needed.

Client Communication: Keep the client informed once you submit the application. They'll be anxious to know things are moving. A confirmation email sets expectations on timelines and next steps:

Subject: "Mortgage Application Submitted – What Happens Next"

Hi [Name],

Good news – I have submitted your mortgage application to ABC Bank today. All your documents and information are now with the lender for review. Here's what to expect next:

Underwriting: The lender's team will review your info and documents. This usually takes about 5–10 working days (though it can be faster).

Valuation: The bank will arrange a valuation of the property. We expect this to be instructed soon (I'll let you know when it's scheduled).

Updates: I will keep you updated at every stage. If the lender needs any additional information or documents, I'll reach out to you right away. Sometimes underwriters have a question or two – that's normal.

Stay Accessible: In the meantime, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me. I'll be monitoring the application and following up with the lender regularly.

Thank you for your patience. We're one big step closer to securing your mortgage! I'll be in touch as soon as there are updates.

– [Broker Name]

This email both reassures the client and educates them on the process (underwriting & valuation are typical sub-steps after submission​
mortgageminds.co.uk
). It's important they know you're actively managing it.

Automation & Tools:

Airtable/CRM Tracking: Mark the deal as "Submitted" in your pipeline (you might have a checkbox or stage field in Airtable). This status change can trigger internal tasks, like setting a follow-up date. For example, you could have an automation: "3 days after submission, if no response yet, send yourself (the broker) a reminder to check in with the lender or get an update." This ensures no application falls through the cracks.

Integration: If you have your Airtable or CRM integrated with email or messaging, you can automate the submission confirmation email too – populate it with lender name, submission date, etc., from your records. Alternatively, use Zapier to draft an email in Gmail or Outlook when you change a status to "Submitted" (Zapier can even use an email template and fill in the blanks, or use OpenAI to dynamically add extra friendly phrasing).

Document forwarding: You might also use automation to organize documents – e.g., when you mark "Submitted", automatically upload the collected documents to a cloud folder named for this client, which can serve as a backup of what was sent.

OpenAI (GPT) in Underwriting: One creative AI use at this stage is drafting any explanatory notes for the underwriter. If there's a quirk in the case (say a gap in employment or a one-time large bank deposit), you usually would write a cover note to explain it. GPT can help articulate these explanations clearly. For example, "Draft a short note to the lender explaining a 1-month job gap, highlighting it was due to relocation and the client has been stable employed since." This can save time formulating messages to the lender.

E-Signatures: To streamline getting any required signatures (application declaration, etc.), use an e-sign tool integrated via Zapier. For instance, when you reach this stage, automatically send a DocuSign request for the client to sign the lender's declaration form. This reduces waiting for physical signatures.

Mortgage-Specific Tech: Small brokers may not have expensive loan origination software, but note that some mortgage broker platforms (LOS) can automate parts of application submission. If you find yourself doing many applications, it could be worth exploring these in the future. For now, the combination of a good spreadsheet/CRM (Airtable) and diligent follow-up can do the job. Just be prepared for manual data entry into lender portals, as that's often unavoidable without a fully integrated system.

## Stage 6: Mortgage Offer & Pre-Completion

Purpose: The lender completes underwriting and (if all is satisfactory) issues a Mortgage Offer – the formal approval of the loan. The broker's role here is to communicate this milestone to the client, ensure the client understands any conditions of the offer, and coordinate next steps (which mostly involve the solicitors handling the legal process up to completion).

Mortgage Offer Receipt: When the lender is satisfied with all checks (including a satisfactory property valuation)​
mortgageminds.co.uk
, they will issue a Mortgage Offer document. This is typically sent to you (the broker), the client, and the client's solicitor. The offer outlines the terms of the loan and is often valid for a certain period (e.g. 3-6 months). Review the offer to see if there are any conditions (common conditions might be "subject to buildings insurance being in place at exchange" or a last-minute document like an updated payslip if the one provided was older).

Communicating to Client: This is a happy stage – let your client know they have been formally approved. Even if the lender also emails them, a personal touch from you is valuable:

Subject: "Congratulations – Your Mortgage Offer is Issued!"

Hello [Name],

Congratulations! [Lender] has approved your mortgage and issued the formal Mortgage Offer. This means your loan of £200,000 is ready, subject to the final legal steps. 🥳

I've attached a copy of the Mortgage Offer document for your records (it's 10 pages, but the key details are summarized below). I will also send a copy to your solicitor (they may already have it).

Key Offer Details:

Loan Amount: £200,000

Product: 5-year fixed at 4.50% (as recommended)

Monthly Payment: ~£1,110

Offer Expiry: 6 months from now (so we need to complete by [Date])

Special Conditions: (1) You'll need to have buildings insurance in place by completion. (2) The offer is subject to a final employment verification by the lender (they occasionally re-check before releasing funds). I'll guide you on these – they're standard.

Next Steps: Your solicitor will now proceed to arrange exchange of contracts and set a completion date for your purchase. Please stay in touch with them and let me know if you need any assistance. I will also check in with the solicitor to ensure everything is on track. Typically, from offer to completion takes a few weeks, mostly handling legal formalities.

In the meantime, now is a good time to think about insurance. We should arrange your building insurance to start by the completion date. I can help with that, and also discuss life or income protection insurance to safeguard your new home – let me know if you're interested.

I'm delighted we've reached this milestone. Feel free to call or email with any questions about the offer. I'll stay involved through completion to ensure a smooth finish.

Congrats again! We're nearly there.

– [Broker Name]

This email not only congratulates the client but also reinforces the broker's value through to completion and introduces cross-selling (insurance) diplomatically, which can be beneficial for both client and broker. It also highlights any conditions in plain language so the client is not confused by jargon in the offer document.

Automation & Tools:

Status Change: Mark the deal as "Offer Received" in Airtable/CRM. This could trigger different automations: for example, move the record to a "Won/Active" list, schedule a task to call the client, and create a reminder for a follow-up in a week if exchange hasn't happened.

Email Template: Use a predefined template for the offer email so you don't forget to mention key points (like insurance or conditions). Merging data like loan amount or rate can be done if those are stored in your system.

Document Handling: When you receive the offer (often as a PDF), you can drag it into the Airtable record (if using Airtable as your main tracker). An automation can then, say, send that PDF to the client automatically with a generic message. However, a personalized email (like above) is better – you might automate a draft but then edit it. OpenAI can assist by summarizing the offer's key points for you. For instance, you could paste the offer text to GPT and ask "extract the main conditions and key loan details from this offer." This can ensure you don't miss anything important when communicating to the client.

Integration with Solicitors: Some brokers use case-tracking systems that include solicitors (especially if it's an all-in-one platform). If not, simple email integration is enough: you might use an email template to forward the offer to the solicitor with a cover note. A snippet for that could be automated as well (like a stored template: "Dear [Solicitor], attached is the offer for [Client]. Please confirm receipt and let me know if you need anything further from my side."). Tools like Zapier could even watch your inbox for the lender's offer email and then forward it to the solicitor automatically, but use such automation carefully to avoid errors.

AI for Client Questions: After an offer, clients might have questions (e.g. "What does APR mean on this page?"). You can use AI to help draft simple explanations that are correct and easy to understand, especially for technical bits. However, ensure accuracy with compliance (if unsure, better to explain yourself or consult official definitions).

Pre-Completion Tasks: Once the offer is out, much of the heavy lifting shifts to the conveyancing solicitors. But a proactive broker will:

Check if the valuation came in fine (usually no news is good news; if there was a down-valuation, that would have been dealt with before offer stage).

Ensure any conditions that need action are being handled (e.g. remind client about insurance or anything to sign).

Keep in touch with the solicitor and client to monitor progress towards exchange of contracts (for purchase) and completion date.

Use a task reminder in your system for the expected completion date so you don't miss congratulating the client or doing post-completion duties.

## Stage 7: Completion & Closing the Deal

Purpose: This is the finish line – the mortgage funds are released by the lender and the property purchase (or remortgage) completes. The broker's role is to ensure everything concludes smoothly and then formally close out the file, including any commission admin and a final thank-you to the client.

Completion Day Coordination: On the day of completion for a purchase, the lender transfers funds to the solicitor, who then sends them to the seller's solicitor – the ownership transfers to the buyer (your client). For a remortgage, the new lender sends funds to pay off the old mortgage. The broker doesn't have much active work on that day aside from being available in case of any last-minute hitches (rare at this point, but possibly if a delay in funds or so). Usually, the solicitor will notify everyone (including broker) once completion has happened.

Commission and Admin: As a broker, once completed, you will get paid any commission from the lender (often a week or two after completion). Ensure you've logged the case as completed in whatever systems (e.g., your network's compliance system, and your Airtable base). For compliance, you might need to store the file for a number of years and mark it as closed. This is more internal, but worth noting as part of closing the loop.

Client Congratulations & Ongoing Relationship: Send a warm congratulatory message to the client on completion. They've just achieved a major milestone (getting the keys to their new home, or successfully refinancing). Even if you spoke on the phone, follow up in writing to commemorate the moment and remind them you're still there for them:

Subject: "Congratulations on Your Completed Mortgage!"

Hi [Name],

Congratulations on completing your mortgage and [buying your new home]! I'm thrilled for you – it's been a pleasure helping you through the process. I hope you're popping a bottle of champagne (or a nice cup of tea!) in your new place. 🥂🏠

As your mortgage broker, my service doesn't end here. A few quick notes now that your mortgage is in place:

First Payment: Your first mortgage payment will be due around [Date] (check the offer document for the exact date/amount). Make sure the direct debit with [Lender] is all set up so it comes out smoothly.

Documents: Keep your Mortgage Offer and completion statement from the solicitor in a safe place. You might need them for reference.

Insurance: If we haven't already, ensure your building insurance is active from today. Let me know if you need any help with life or home insurance; it's important to have those protections now that you have a mortgage.

Future Reviews: I'll reach out periodically (at least annually and a few months before any fixed rate ends) to review your mortgage and make sure it's still the best deal for you. In the meantime, if you have any questions or if your circumstances change (new job, plans to move, etc.), please feel free to get in touch. I'm here to help anytime.

Finally, I rely on referrals and would love to help any friends or family of yours who might need mortgage advice. If you know someone who could use my assistance, I would greatly appreciate an introduction. And if you have a moment to share feedback on your experience, a short review on Google would mean a lot to me in growing my small business.

Thank you once again for trusting me as your broker – it's been an absolute pleasure. I wish you all the best in your new home!

Cheers,
[Broker Name]

This message achieves several things: sincerely congratulates the client, provides useful tips (first payment, document storage, insurance reminder), sets the stage for future contact (annual review, etc.), and gently asks for referrals/reviews which are gold for a small broker.

Automation & Tools:

Triggered Email: Changing the case status to "Completed" in Airtable could automatically send out a pre-drafted congratulations email (perhaps with merge fields for first payment date or other personalized items you've stored). However, you might want to customize it for each client, so even an automation that drafts an email for you to approve can be helpful.

Review Request: It's good practice to send a separate short email or text with a direct link to your Google Reviews or Trustpilot, making it easy for the client to leave a review. This can be semi-automated. For instance, using Zapier: when a record is marked completed, it could send an Gmail email with a simple template: "Thank you for choosing [Brokerage]. We'd love your feedback – please leave a review at [link]." Or use an Airtable script to personalize a review request (maybe referencing something unique from their journey to avoid a generic feel).

AI for Feedback Requests: Crafting the perfect review request or survey can be done with AI assistance. The Accord Mortgages Growth Series suggests using ChatGPT for tasks like drafting an email requesting a Google review from a customer in a friendly tone​
blog.accordmortgages.com
. In fact, one of their example prompts is: "As a member of staff within a mortgage brokerage, draft an email requesting a Google review from a customer whom we have helped take out a new mortgage. Use a friendly tone and no more than 100 words."​
blog.accordmortgages.com
. You can use a prompt like that to get a nice, concise review request email, then send it to clients automatically.

Closing File Automation: If you maintain spreadsheets or trackers, mark the deal as closed and perhaps log the commission received. Airtable can be used to track commission due and paid, and an automation could notify you if a payment isn't received by X date, etc. This ensures the business side is wrapped up.

Stay-in-Touch Sequence: Add the client to your mailing list or CRM for long-term nurturing. A simple approach: have an "Active Clients" table or list – once the mortgage is complete, move them to a "Past Clients" group that receives occasional newsletters or check-in emails. MailChimp or SendinBlue can integrate with Airtable (via Zapier) to add the client to an email sequence (e.g. a "6 months home owner check-in" email, an annual newsletter about interest rates, etc.). This is automated marketing that keeps you in their mind for future needs or referrals.

## Stage 8: Post-Completion Follow-Up & Retention

Purpose: Maintain the client relationship after completion and leverage automation for future opportunities. This stage isn't a one-time event but an ongoing cycle of follow-ups. It includes checking in on the client's satisfaction, keeping their information up-to-date, and timing future mortgage events (like rate expiries) for retention business (remortgages or product transfers).

Immediate Follow-Up: A week or two after completion, it's wise to check in with the client to ensure all is well. This could be a quick call or a personal email: "Hope you're settling in! Let me know if any questions came up." It's another touchpoint that shows you care beyond the transaction. This can be diarized at completion time.

Survey or Feedback: As mentioned, sending a short survey is valuable. You can use Airtable forms or tools like Google Forms to ask the client about their experience. For example, an Airtable form with a few questions (rated 1-5) on service, and a text box for comments. This feedback can help improve your process. Automate the sending of this survey link via email (possibly along with the completion congratulations or a few days after). Gathering testimonials can also feed your marketing (with permission).

Database Updates: Ensure the client's record in Airtable/CRM has all relevant data for the future:

Mortgage details (lender, product, rate, term, completion date).

Product renewal date – e.g. if it's a 5-year fix completing in June 2028, note that.

Review dates – maybe set a field for an annual check-in each year, and a critical one ~6 months before rate expiry.

Remortgage Reminders: A huge value for brokers is capturing the remortgage when the client's initial deal expires. Rather than relying on memory, use automation. For instance, create a formula in Airtable for "Remortgage Due Date = Fixed End Date minus 4 months." Then use Airtable Automations or Zapier to trigger an email to the client at that time. The email could say:

Subject: "Your Mortgage Rate Expires Soon – Let's Plan Ahead"

Hi [Name], I hope you're well. It's been almost five years since we arranged your mortgage with ABC Bank. Your fixed rate is ending in 4 months, on [Date]. After that, the rate will revert to the lender's variable rate, which could mean higher payments.

We have an opportunity now to look at switching you to a new deal and keep your payments as low as possible. This is a great time to review your mortgage. I'd like to schedule a quick check-in to discuss your options – we might be able to secure a new fixed rate or even consider a product transfer with ABC Bank.

To get started, please let me know a good time for a chat. I've also prepared a short update form here: [Airtable Update Form Link] where you can update any changes to your income or situation since we last spoke. This will help me see what new deals you qualify for.

Looking forward to ensuring you continue to have the best mortgage deal. Talk soon,

– [Broker Name]

Such an email can be largely automated: you know the date, you have a template ready, and an Airtable prefilled form can be used for them to update info (which creates a mini fact-find update in your system). Using Zapier/Make, you can schedule this to send at the appropriate time or have a view filtered to "send remortgage email" and use an automation to send for each client in that view. This ensures you never miss a client's renewal, which is key for client retention and repeat business.

AI in Ongoing Engagement: AI tools can help you keep in touch with clients in a personalized way, even as your client base grows:

Content Generation: Use OpenAI to draft periodic newsletter content – for example, "summarize the current mortgage market rates and outlook in simple terms for my past clients" or "create a friendly email about the importance of remortgaging, addressed to homeowners". This can feed your marketing emails or blog posts, saving you time formulating topics.

Personalized Check-ins: For a more personal touch at scale, you might feed some client context to GPT and ask it to draft a check-in email. E.g., "Client bought first home in 2023 in London, fixed rate ending 2025, draft a casual check-in asking how they're doing in the new home, and reminding we're here to review the mortgage when needed." This can give you a nice starting point that you tweak.

Client Queries: If a client asks a complex question via email (like details about interest rates or an aspect of the process), you can verify the facts and even run a draft answer by an AI to ensure clarity. There's also potential to set up a client self-service FAQ chatbot on your website using your knowledge base, which could answer general queries (like "How do I get a copy of my offer?" or "What's the process for porting my mortgage?") – but this is optional for a small broker, depending on how much volume you handle.

Cross-Selling and Ongoing Service: Aside from remortgages, consider other needs:

Protection Insurance: Many brokers also advise on life insurance, income protection, etc. After mortgage completion is a good time (the client's finances and needs are fresh) to revisit this. You might automate a follow-up a month after completion: "Now that you're settled, have you thought about insurance? I can help if you need life cover to protect the mortgage," etc.

Referrals: Keep a referral program active. Every few years or when you sense the client's satisfaction, remind them you welcome referrals. Maybe send a thank-you note or small gift for any referrals that turn into business (this can be noted in your CRM and even automated partially – e.g., trigger an email saying thank you when a new lead mentions an existing client as referrer).

Tools for Retention:

CRM Reminders: If not using Airtable for this, even a Google Calendar or task manager can remind you of key dates. But Airtable can be your one source of truth: one table of clients with next contact date, and an automation to email you a weekly digest of "Who to reach out to this week".

Email Marketing Platforms: As your client list grows, consider migrating them into an email marketing tool (Mailchimp, etc.) for scalable newsletters. These can be automated on schedules (e.g., a quarterly update on the market, or a Christmas greeting to all clients).

Client Portal: If using something like a client portal (some broker softwares have this), clients could log in and see their mortgage details, upcoming important dates, and even initiate a remortgage request. For a solo broker using mostly low-cost tools, you might simulate this with Airtable's Interface Designer – for example, creating a simple interface where a client (with a unique link) could see the data you have for them or submit an update. That's a more advanced Airtable use case, but potentially valuable for tech-savvy brokers.

Compliance & Record-Keeping: Post-completion, ensure all the client's data and documents are stored properly as per regulatory requirements (the FCA requires retention of records for several years). Airtable can serve as a repository, but consider backing up documents to a secure cloud storage or your network's system. You might automate a backup: Zapier can copy attachments from Airtable to Google Drive or OneDrive labeled by client name. This protects the info long-term and frees you to clean up older records if needed.
