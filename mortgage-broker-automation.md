## Why Not Use Airtable Forms?

While Airtable is excellent as a backend database and CRM solution, its native forms have several limitations compared to dedicated form tools like Typeform or Tally:

### Limited Customization

- Fewer styling options and branding capabilities
- Basic form layout with limited visual customization
- Less professional appearance for client-facing interactions

### Restricted Form Logic

- Limited conditional logic for showing/hiding fields
- Basic branching capabilities
- Fewer field validation options

### User Experience Limitations

- Less intuitive interface for complex form completion
- Not optimized for mobile experiences
- No progress indicators or multi-page functionality
- Limited save-and-continue capabilities

### Technical Constraints

- File upload size limitations
- Fewer question types and input formats
- Limited ability to embed calculators or interactive elements

### Integration Capabilities

- Integrates well with Airtable itself but has fewer native integrations with other services
- More limited automation trigger options
- No native payment processing or signature collection

### Analytics & Insights

- Basic submission tracking
- Limited form completion analytics
- No heat mapping or user behavior insights

For a professional mortgage broker service, dedicated form tools provide a significantly better first impression and user experience, which is crucial for converting leads into clients.
