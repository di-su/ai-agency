# AI Automation Agency for UK Mortgage Brokers: Summary

This document summarizes the key discussion points about starting an AI automation agency focused on serving independent UK mortgage brokers.

## 1. What is an AI Automation Agency?

- **Core Idea:** A service business that helps other businesses (like mortgage brokers) automate repetitive tasks using existing AI and no-code/low-code tools.
- **Focus:** Improving efficiency, saving time, managing leads/clients better, and ultimately helping the client make more money.
- **Not about building custom software:** Primarily involves configuring and integrating tools like Zapier, Make, Airtable, Notion, Google Drive, Tally/Typeform, Calendly, Twilio, and AI APIs (like ChatGPT).

## 2. Why Target Independent UK Mortgage Brokers?

- **Good Niche Characteristics:**
  - **Process-Heavy:** Workflow involves many repetitive steps (lead intake, document chasing, updates).
  - **Independent/Hungry:** Often self-employed or under networks (Appointed Representatives - ARs), directly motivated by commission/closing deals.
  - **Less Tech-Savvy:** Likely overwhelmed by admin and open to solutions that simplify their work without requiring technical expertise.
  - **High-Ticket Value:** Brokers earn significant commission per deal (£750-£1250+), making a monthly fee for automation ROI-positive if it saves time or helps close even one extra deal.
  - **Large Market:** Significant number of individual advisors in the UK (FCA reported ~36,441 adviser posts in 2022), many working independently.
- **Contrast with other niches:**
  - _Recruiters:_ Viable, but potentially more saturated and might use existing CRMs.
  - _Personal Trainers:_ More relationship-based, automation might feel less natural, but still possible for admin tasks (scheduling, check-ins).
  - _Large Businesses:_ Less likely to adopt piecemeal automation, prefer enterprise solutions.

## 3. The Opportunity: Improving the Broker's Workflow

- **Typical Pain Points (Manual Workflow):**
  - Inconsistent lead capture (emails, DMs).
  - Manual data entry into spreadsheets/basic CRMs.
  - Time wasted chasing clients for documents.
  - Disorganized file management.
  - Repetitive status updates and scheduling.
  - Lack of systematic follow-up for future business.
- **Automation Solutions (The Service Offering):**
  - **Lead Intake:** Smart forms (Tally/Typeform) feeding into a CRM (Airtable/Notion).
  - **Document Collection:** Automated checklists, reminders (email/SMS via Zapier/Twilio), and secure upload links feeding organized folders (Google Drive).
  - **CRM/Pipeline:** Centralized tracking (Airtable/Notion) showing deal stages, missing items, and triggering actions.
  - **Communication:** Templated/AI-assisted emails (Gmail/Outlook via Zapier), automated status updates.
  - **Scheduling:** Integrated booking links (Calendly/TidyCal).
  - **Follow-up:** Automated post-deal thank yous and future review reminders.

## 4. Technical Implementation & Costs

- **Core Stack:** Zapier/Make, Airtable/Notion, Tally/Typeform, Google Drive, Calendly/TidyCal, Gmail/Outlook, Twilio (optional for SMS), ChatGPT API (optional for advanced features).
- **No Custom Code Needed Initially:** Focus is on configuring and connecting these tools.
- **Low Running Costs:** Many tools have generous free tiers. A basic setup for a few clients might cost £0-£50 per month total, scaling as more clients or advanced features (paid Zapier/Make plans, Twilio SMS) are added.

## 5. Pricing & Business Model

- **Models:**
  - **Setup Fee + Retainer:** One-time fee (£500-£1500) for building the system, plus a smaller monthly fee (£50-£200) for support/maintenance.
  - **Monthly Subscription:** Simpler recurring fee (£99-£299/month) providing access to the configured system and support.
- **Justification:** Frame the cost based on ROI (time saved = more deals closed). £100/month is easily justifiable if it saves hours per week or helps close one extra £1000+ commission deal per month.
- **Control:** Access can be managed by controlling shared access to tools like Airtable, Zapier (if using your account), Google Drive folders.

## 6. Data Protection (UK GDPR/FCA)

- **Is it an issue?** No, not inherently, provided best practices are followed.
- **Key Principles:** Use reputable, secure tools (major platforms generally are); ensure the broker has clear privacy policies informing clients how data (handled by your system) is used; act as a data processor, not controller; implement sensible security (access controls).
- **Broker Responsibility:** Ultimately, compliance lies with the broker (the data controller), but your system should facilitate good practice.

## 7. Getting Started

- **Strategy:** Coffee chat with a friendly broker (like yours) to understand pain points directly.
- **Offer:** Build a simple version of the automation (e.g., lead intake + doc checklist) for free/cheap to prove value and get a testimonial.
- **Goal:** Aim for ~30 clients @ £100/month = £3k/month (£36k/year), which seems achievable given the market size and value proposition.
